# Modeling-Project-Week-5

Members of the group: Nina and Cristina

We will work on Modeling project: Real estate modeling.
 The task is to build a model that will predict the price of a house based on features provided in the dataset. 

Brief description of the dataset:
- Source Ironhack  number of features)
- number of rows 21598
- number of columns 21
- number of features?

# High-level Planning of the project, e.g:

## Day 1 - EDA

## Day 2 - Clean the data
Remove typos of duplicate
Correct datatypes
...

## Day 3
Transform the data
Scale Numerical Features
Encode Categorical Features
...

## Day 4 - Modelling
Split data
...

## Day 5 - Presentation
